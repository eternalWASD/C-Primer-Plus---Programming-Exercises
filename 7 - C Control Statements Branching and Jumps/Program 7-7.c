/* Write a program that requests the hours worked in a week and then prints the gross pay, 
the taxes, and the net pay. Assume the following: 
a. Basic pay rate = $10.00/hr 
b. Overtime (in excess of 40 hours) = time and a half 
c. Tax rate: #15% of the first $300 
20% of the next $150 
25% of the rest 
Use #define constants, and donâ€™t worry if the example does not conform to current 
tax law. */
